A contact list of Chaves characters

## Config
  - install `yarn` in your computer
  - run `yarn global add json-server`
  - run `yarn` command inside project to install dependencies

## Run
  - run `yarn json-server` to run json-server in port 4000
  - run `yarn start` to run the project
  - if you find any trouble while bringing up any service, try changing the port

## Usage
  - You can see a list of contacts and you can add more contacts.
  - If you go to `registration form`, you can create a new contact (all fields must be filled)
  - Clicking `delete button` will actually delete the contact from the list.
  - Typing any character inside `filter input` will filter and only show contacts whose name match with the letters typed in the input fild

### Limitations
  1. To add a picture, you should type only the file name that is inside `public/assets/images`, without the extension or the filepath.
